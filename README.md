## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
- A text editor (like VS Code) to save the files.

### How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files manually):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-folder>
    ```
    Alternatively, create a new folder and add three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

2.  **Add the Code**: Ensure the complete code for each of the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) is in its respective file.

3.  **Save the Background Image**: Download the background image you want to use, rename it to **`sudoku-bg.png`**, and save it in the same folder as the three files.

4.  **Open in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. The game will start immediately.
